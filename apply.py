# 3a) use a for loop to print the name of each topping
# 3b) modify your loop to print a sentence using the name of the topping instead of printing just the name of the topping
# for example: "I like ham"
# 4) add a line after the loop that states how much you like pizza

# 2) print the length of the list
# 3) print the first and last items
# 4) verify this again by using the min and max functions to make sure that it begins and ends correctly
# 5) use the sum function to see how fast python can add these numbers
